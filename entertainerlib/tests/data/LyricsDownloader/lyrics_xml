The finest day that I've ever had[br]
Was when I learned to cry on command[br]
I love myself better than you[br]
I know it's wrong so what should I do?[br]
[br]

I'm on a plain[br]
I can't complain[br]
I'm on a plain[br]
[br]

My mother died every night[br]
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that[br]
I love myself better than you[br]
I know it's wrong so what should I do?[br]
[br]

The black sheep got blackmailed again[br]
Forgot to put on the zip code[br]
I love myself better than you[br]
I know it's wrong so what should I do?[br]
[br]

I'm on a plain[br]
I can't complain[br]
I'm on a plain[br]
[br]

Somewhere I have heard this before[br]
In a dream my memory has stored[br]
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed[br]
What the hell am I trying to say?[br]
[br]

It is now time to make it unclear[br]
To write off lines that don't make sense[br]
I love myself better than you[br]
I know it's wrong so what should I do?[br]
[br]

And one more special message to go[br]
And then I'm done, then I can go home[br]
I love myself better than you[br]
I know it's wrong so what should I do?[br]
[br]

I'm on a plain[br]
I can't complain[br]
I'm on a plain[br]
I can't complain[br]
[br]

I'm on a plain[br]
I can't complain[br]
I'm on a plain[br]
I can't complain[br]
[br]
