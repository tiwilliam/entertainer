Description: 
                Entertainer aims to be a simple and easy-to-use media center solution
                for GNOME and Xfce desktop environments. Entertainer is written
                completely in Python using object-oriented programming paradigm.
                It uses the gstreamer multimedia framework for multimedia playback.
                The user Interface is implemented with Clutter UI-library, which
                creates sleek OpenGL animated user interfaces. Entertainer also uses
                other great projects like SQLite and iNotify for caching media
